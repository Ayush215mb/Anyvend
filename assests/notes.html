    <!-- Dimensions  of the product will be 

    Length - max 16cm

    -->

<!--     
    Total length of belt is 66cm

    Every product should be assigned to the belt based on height in the multiples of two and always rounded to next big decimal.

    Eg:  if the product height is 15cm the product must be assigned for 0-16cm.

    If I add 5 chocolates of height 2cm , there must a table/que where I should see the location details assigned on belt for 5 chocolates.

    Eg: as we have one product with 16cm blocked. And I have added 5 chocolates in admin. Now I should be having locations of 5 chocolates 
    Chocolate 1 16-18
    Chocolate 2. 18-20
    Chocolate 3 20-22
    .
    Chocolate 4 24-26.

    Now total available length for next products will be 66-26 =40  -->
